This page demonstrates a product catalog with an animated side panel modal using the HTML `<dialog>` element. Users can click on product cards to view detailed information in a non-modal or modal dialog panel that slides in from the right, with the ability to toggle between the two modes using a switch. The side panel includes a feedback form that allows visitors to submit comments about each product.
