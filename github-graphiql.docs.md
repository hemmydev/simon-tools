This GitHub GraphQL Explorer provides an interactive interface for querying GitHub's GraphQL API with proper authentication. Users input their GitHub personal access token to establish a secure connection and then execute queries against the API using the integrated GraphiQL editor. The interface includes session storage for token persistence, real-time status notifications for query results, and a helpful default query template to get started.
