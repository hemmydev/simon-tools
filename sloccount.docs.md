This SLOCCount web application analyzes source code to count physical lines of code (SLOC) across multiple programming languages using WebAssembly-compiled Perl and C-based counter algorithms. Users can provide code through three methods: pasting code snippets with manual language detection, analyzing public GitHub repositories via their API, or uploading ZIP files containing source code. The tool generates detailed statistics including language breakdown, file counts, and cost/effort estimates using the Basic COCOMO software engineering model with customizable parameters for developer salary and overhead costs.
