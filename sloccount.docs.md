SLOCCount is a web-based tool that analyzes source code to count physical lines of code (SLOC) using WebAssembly-compiled Perl and C programs. It supports multiple input methods including direct code pasting, GitHub repository analysis, and ZIP file uploads, with automatic language detection and cost estimation using the COCOMO model. The tool provides detailed breakdowns by programming language and generates estimates for development effort, schedule, and cost based on customizable parameters like developer salary and project overhead.
