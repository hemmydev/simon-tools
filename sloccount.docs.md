SLOCCount enables source code analysis by counting physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) using WebAssembly-powered Perl and C programs. The tool supports three input methods: direct code paste, GitHub repository analysis, and ZIP file upload. After analyzing your code, it provides detailed statistics including total lines, language breakdown, and estimated development costs calculated using the Basic COCOMO model.
