This page is an interactive source code analyzer that counts lines of code across multiple programming languages using WebAssembly-compiled Perl and C programs based on the SLOCCount algorithm. Users can analyze code by pasting it directly, providing a GitHub repository URL, or uploading a ZIP file, with the tool automatically detecting languages and calculating COCOMO software cost estimates using editable parameters like developer salary and overhead multipliers. The estimates are intentionally presented as extremely rough approximations since actual development costs vary significantly based on project complexity, team experience, and other real-world factors.
