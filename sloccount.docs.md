SLOCCount is a tool that counts the Source Lines of Code (SLOC) in programming files. Users can paste their code and provide a filename for language detection, then receive a detailed analysis including total lines, file count, language breakdown, and estimated development costs based on the COCOMO model. The tool runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly technology to execute Perl code for accurate line counting.
