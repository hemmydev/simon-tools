The Percentage Recalculator allows you to redistribute percentages to sum up to 100%. Enter up to four percentage values and use the "Ignore this" checkbox to exclude specific values from recalculation. The tool automatically displays the original values alongside recalculated percentages that maintain their relative proportions while summing to 100%.
