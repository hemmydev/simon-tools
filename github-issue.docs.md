This application fetches GitHub issues and their comments via the GitHub API, converting them into formatted markdown that users can easily copy. Users can input a GitHub issue URL and optionally provide a personal access token to increase API rate limits and access private repositories; the token is securely stored in the browser's local storage for convenience. The tool displays the issue title, metadata, description, and all associated comments in a readable markdown format with copy-to-clipboard functionality.
