This keyboard debugger tool displays keypress events in real-time. When you press keys on your keyboard, they appear visually on screen with animated glass-like cards. The tool shows the key name, key code, and keyCode values for each pressed key, supporting multiple simultaneous keypresses and special key representations like arrows and modifiers.
