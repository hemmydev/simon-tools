This tool allows you to retrieve GitHub account information by entering a username. It displays the account's numeric ID, creation date, and avatar by making a request to the GitHub REST API. The interface provides clear feedback about rate limits when they occur and automatically demonstrates functionality by looking up "octocat" on initial page load.
