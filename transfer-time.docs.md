The Transfer Time Calculator helps you estimate how long it will take to upload or download files. Enter your file size (in GB, MB, or TB) and the transfer speed (in MB/s, Mbps, or KB/s), and the calculator will display the estimated time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The result includes a detailed breakdown of the calculation so you can understand exactly how the time was determined.
