This tool allows you to manipulate text indentation and formatting. Paste text in the textarea and use the buttons to add or remove indentation with 2 or 4 spaces, completely remove all indentation, or add/remove quote markers at the beginning of each line. The tool automatically detects when all non-empty lines are quoted and provides an option to unquote.
