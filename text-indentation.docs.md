This tool helps you manage text indentation with a set of one-click operations. You can add 2 or 4 spaces of indentation to each line of your text, remove 2 or 4 spaces from the beginning of each line, or strip all leading whitespace. Paste your text into the textarea and use the buttons to transform the indentation as needed.
