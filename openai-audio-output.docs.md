This page provides an interface for generating speech using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio API models. Users input system and user prompts, select a model and voice, then submit to receive audio output along with the API response in JSON format. The page includes features for playing and downloading the generated audio, copying the API response, and optionally saving results to GitHub Gists for sharing.
