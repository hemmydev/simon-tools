This tool allows users to authenticate with GitHub and monitor their API rate limits across different resource types. After authentication, users can view their current usage, remaining calls, and reset times for the core API and other GitHub API resources. The interface displays visual indicatorsâ€”showing warnings when usage approaches limits and critical alerts when remaining calls drop below 10% of the limit.
