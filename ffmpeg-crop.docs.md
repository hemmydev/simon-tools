This tool allows you to visually select a crop area for video files and generates the corresponding FFmpeg commands. Upload a video, then use the green crop box to define the region you want to keep. The tool provides both standard FFmpeg commands and iPhone-compatible commands with appropriate encoding settings for your cropped video.
