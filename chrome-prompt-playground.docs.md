The Chrome LanguageModel Playground allows you to interact with Chrome's built-in AI model directly in your browser. This interface checks for model availability, handles the download process if needed, and provides a simple prompt interface where you can enter text and receive AI-generated responses. Your interaction history is saved locally for future reference, and you can manage these saved conversations through the history panel.
