This tool helps visualize image segmentation masks using the Gemini API. Upload an image and provide a prompt to generate JSON containing bounding boxes and segmentation masks for objects in the image. The application displays the original image with overlaid masks, coordinate grids, and side-by-side comparisons of each detected region and its corresponding mask.
