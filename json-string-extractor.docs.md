This tool extracts strings from JSON that are longer than 20 characters or contain newlines. Paste your JSON into the text area or use the buttons to load example data or a GitHub Gist. The extracted strings are displayed with their path in the original JSON structure, and you can easily copy individual strings to your clipboard.
