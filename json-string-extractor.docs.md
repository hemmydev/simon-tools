The JSON String Extractor tool helps you find and extract all strings from a JSON document that are longer than 20 characters or contain newlines. After pasting your JSON data into the input area, the tool parses it, extracts matching strings along with their paths, and displays them as resizable text areas sorted by length. Each extracted string can be easily copied to your clipboard with a single click.
