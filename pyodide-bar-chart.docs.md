This demo showcases how to run Python data analysis directly in the browser using Pyodide. The page loads pandas and matplotlib libraries via WebAssembly, processes sample data, and renders a bar chart without any server-side processing. Users can re-run the visualization or view the underlying Python code that generates the chart.
