This tool converts terminal output in multiple formats (RTF, HTML, and plain text) into clean, styled HTML code. Users paste colored terminal output from their clipboard, and the application parses the formatting to generate corresponding HTML with preserved colors and styling. The tool provides options to copy the generated HTML or save it as a GitHub Gist for easy sharing.
