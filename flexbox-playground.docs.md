The CSS Flexbox Playground provides an interactive environment for experimenting with flexbox layout properties. Users can adjust container settings like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items through the control panel, and modify individual flex item properties such as flex-grow and align-self by selecting specific items. The playground displays real-time visual results and generates the corresponding CSS code, making it a practical tool for learning and testing flexbox layouts.
