This tool converts JSON transcripts to Markdown format. Paste your JSON containing timestamps, speakers, and text into the left panel, and the conversion happens automatically. The tool expects a specific JSON structure with an "items" array containing speaker, text, and timestamp fields, which can be generated using the LLM command shown in the instructions.
