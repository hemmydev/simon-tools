This interactive tool allows you to upload images and compare different compression and resize options. Upload an image by dropping it into the designated area, selecting a file, or pasting from your clipboard. Once uploaded, you can adjust the crop area using the handles, then view multiple versions with different quality settings and dimensions. For transparent images, a background color selector appears to customize the fill color.
