This interactive lab provides hands-on practice with NumPy vector and matrix operations. Users work through five exercises covering creation, element-wise operations, dot products, matrix multiplication, broadcasting, and array slicing with immediate feedback. The page includes a reference guide of common NumPy operations and a playground environment for experimenting with custom code.
